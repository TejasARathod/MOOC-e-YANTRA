## AIM

In this experiment, we had to interface the Bar-graph LEDs and the Interrupt Switch already present on Firebird V robot. The aim of this experiment is to get you familiar with the configuring and interfacing of Input and Output devices.
Out task was to toggle the status of 2 Bar-graph LEDs depending on whether the Interrupt Switch is pressed or released.
## Connections
- Interrupt Switch : PE7

**NOTE:** There are two switches present on Firebird-V. One is Reset Switch and the other is Interrupt Switch. In this experiment we will be using the Interrupt Switch which is connected to an External Interrupt Pin (PE7 / INT7) and hence the name.

- Bar-graph LED:
   	  
        LED 1   -->   PJ0
        LED 2   -->   PJ1
        LED 3   -->   PJ2
        LED 4   -->   PJ3
   	    LED 5   -->   PJ4
   	    LED 6   -->   PJ5
   	    LED 7   -->   PJ6
   	    LED 8   -->   PJ7
